# Deployment Guide

## GitHub Setup

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**

   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Initialize Git and push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect to Vercel**

   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

2. **Environment Variables (if needed)**

   - If you have any environment variables (like Supabase keys), add them in Vercel's project settings
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables

3. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
   - Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete

## Important Notes

- âœ… **Turbopack removed**: We removed the `--turbopack` flag to fix the compilation error
- âœ… **Port 9002**: Your app will run on port 9002 locally, but Vercel will use its own port
- âœ… **Build settings**: Vercel will automatically run `npm install` and `npm run build`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors on Vercel:

1. Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Verify TypeScript configuration is correct

Your project is now ready for deployment! ðŸš€
